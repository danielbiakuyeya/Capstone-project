                My pet dog is my best friend in the world. We sleep together, 
                eat together, play together and also love our mom and dad together. 
                He is not just our pet dog but my brother and an 
                important member of my family. 
                The unconditional love and loyalty he shows to us 
                are never seen in anybody that I know off.

                Man's best friend always manifests his solidarity and infinite loyalty.
                 Many dog stories tell us how they have literally given their lives for their owners.
                 In dangerous situations, these animals do not hesitate to do 
                 everything in their power to save humans, even if they are strangers.
                 I'm going to give you guys some fun stories about my pet dog.
