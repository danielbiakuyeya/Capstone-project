                    When I was four years old I had a little dog named Benny. 
                    He was a faithful dog to our family.
                    He used to take care of me when I was little.
                    Mother always trusted Benny because he was never known to leave me or allow anyone to touch me.
                    One day when I was in the house playing with my dolls, Benny was not with me. 
                    I knew that the back door was open and I could get outdoors without being seen. 
                    So I got my dolly all dressed up because I was going to take her too. 
                    I put my coat and hat on and started off. 
                    My dolly and I got outdoors and had started down the lane to the canal when I felt something p7ulling on my dress. 
                    I looked around and there was Benny. Oh, how angry I was. I slapped Benny but he knew I was doing wrong.
                    He pulled me home. When I got home mother and my grandmother were looking for me. 
                    When they saw Benny pulling me they gave on scream and rant to me and Benny. 
                    Benny wagged his tail. 
                    Mother put me to bed, but she gave Benny a big piece of meat.

                <h3>Amazing Dog Story About a Recovery on an Oil Rig</h3>

                  Oil rig workers were stunned to find a dog in the water. This happened in 2019. 
                  The oil rig was 220 kilometers off the coast of Thailand. 
                  This cute puppy managed to swim to the platform, where he clung desperately to the base.
                  The crew built a rudimentary leash and practiced for 15 minutes before getting it around the animal's neck.
                  They were able to drag it to safety.
                  The dog was dried, refreshed with water and meat, and was also given a cute flower garland to wear. 
                  The crew members also gave him some kennel and named him Boonrod.
                  In Thailand, this term is used for survivors who have good karma.
                  Once Boonrod was brought ashore, the vets declared the dog to be in good health and housed him at an animal rescue group.
                  One of the oil rig workers, Vitisak Payalaw, said he would adopt Boonrod if no one offered him a permanent home.
                  It is unclear how the dog ended up this far from the coast, but he probably fell off a fishing vessel.

                  In 2016, Joanie Simpson of Texas went through a challenging time.
                  Her 62-year-old son underwent surgery, her daughter's husband had lost his job, and a property purchase deal was going badly.
                  Worse still, her beloved Yorkshire terrier Meha had congestive heart failure.
                  Joanie loved that little dog madly, but her pet was so sick that Joanie had arranged Meha's date to proceed with the euthanasia.
                  Unfortunately, when that day arrived, Meha seemed to be fine, and Joanie canceled the appointment.
                  The Yorkshire died of natural causes the next day, but terribly in the sight of its owner.One morning, Joanie woke up with all the symptoms of a heart attack.
                  Joanie was flown to a Houston hospital where emergency personnel was preparing for her arrival.
                  However, it turned out that Joanie never had a heart attack: she instead experienced a real medical condition called “broken heart syndrome.”
                  This sometimes fatal condition mimics heart attacks and can be triggered by strong emotions, such as bereavement.
                  Since dog owners often cry intensely over their pets, it shouldn't surprise us that Joanie wasn't the first recorded case in which someone developed this dangerous condition after their dog died.

                  <h5>A Dog Story of Love For A Dog Could Be Genetic</h5>
                  <div class="name-2">

                    In 2019, researchers wondered if love for dogs was genetic, and Sweden was the perfect place to find out.
                    The country has the largest number of twins and requires all dogs to be registered with the Swedish Board of Agriculture (an organization for agricultural development).
                    Twin studies allow scientists to compare genetic, behavioral, and environmental data between people who share 50-100% DNA.
                    The 2019 study was very accurate, looking at data from more than 85,000 adult twins. 
                    Next, the team went through dog ownership records for 15 years. Only a little over 8,500 people owned a dog as a pet.
                    Surprisingly, computer models found that genetics and environmental factors could predict those most likely to adopt a dog equally.
                    While the exact genes remain unidentified, the dog lover's DNA patterns were slightly higher in women.
                    The study added an interesting piece to previous research on the health benefits of dog ownership.
                    He suggested that health benefits such as improved fitness and mood could be partially explained by genetics.
